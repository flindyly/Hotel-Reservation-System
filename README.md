# Hotel-Management-System
Project type: Individual

Status: Completed (21/10/2021)

## Project Description

This project focuses on the development of an online hotel reservation system for guests. When the guest accesses the online system, he/she can choose to login as an existing customer or create a new account. When creating a new account, the system will store the user’s login details so that the user does not have to create a new account every time they access the program. Once authenticated, the guest has two options: search for rooms, or cancel a previous booking. 

If the guest chooses to search for a specific type of room to book, a list of available room numbers will be displayed. If no rooms are available, the system will alert the guest and the guest has an option to search again for another room type. The guest selects the room number they want to book, and a summary of the booking will be generated with the user’s information already retrieved and a unique booking ID generated. The guest will be directed to the payments portal where they can choose to pay by credit/debit card, PayPal or BPAY. Each payment method will have different methods of calculating the cost due to the surcharges. An invoice of their payment will be displayed, and the guest has an option to make another booking. If yes, they get directed to the booking screen; otherwise, the guest is redirected back to the main menu (logged out of account). 

If the guest chooses to cancel a booking, the guest enters in their booking ID and the system alerts whether it was a successful cancellation, along with the refund value. That specific room will then be made vacant to other guests.
